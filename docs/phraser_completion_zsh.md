## phraser completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(phraser completion zsh)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	phraser completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_phraser"

#### macOS:

	phraser completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_phraser

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
